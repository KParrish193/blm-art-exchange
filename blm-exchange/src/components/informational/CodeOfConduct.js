                    <h5>
                        We expect all parties participating in ArtxBLM - including but not limited to leadership, 
                        artists, and supporters - to uphold our core values as laid out below. We take these values 
                        very seriously, as they guide the operations of ArtxBLM as a community.
                    </h5>

                    </ol>
                    <hr style={{color: 'white', backgroundColor: 'white'}}/>
                    <b><i>Reflexivity. </i></b>We believe that knowledge is dynamic, that we can never be done learning, and it is our responsibility to both 
                    ensure our decisions are founded in reliable information and to constantly be working to learn more. As We learn more, we are 
                    more than willing to revise our decisions and update them to reflect current knowledge. Our operations are guided by this 
                    principle, meaning that we will regularly review decisions regarding how we communicate with artists and distribute funds. 
                    We expect all Artists participating in ARTXBLM to do the same.<br/>
                    <br/>

                    <b><i>Transparency.  </i></b>It is critical that We at ARTXBLM are transparent about who we are, what we stand for, and how this shapes 
                    our decision-making, because every member of the community has a right to this knowledge. We at ARTXBLM will personally vet each of the 
                    Charities that receive our donations following periodic discussions about where funds will have the most impact. The pathway of how 
                    funds are distributed will be made readily accessible, as displayed on our home page. We will use our website and/or social media to 
                    highlight the importance of donating to the parties identified, and include links back to websites and profiles for supporters to learn 
                    more. We understand the importance of making these transactions transparent so that every person using the website feels confident that 
                    the profits from each sale  are without fail being donated to worthy causes. With every purchase, we will communicate through receipt 
                    specific information about where their money is going.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    
                    <b><i>Accessibility & Inclusivity. </i></b>ARTXBLM strives to be an inclusive and accessible environment for Artists, Buyers, Supporters, 
                    and Organisers. We expect all parties  to consider accessibility & inclusivity regarding the art that is created and shared, the language 
                    used, and interactions with one another.  We must carefully consider how our decisions include or exclude groups and work to combat any 
                    inequities proactively. For example, we will work to include image descriptions on artworks, to provide translations to our ability, and 
                    seek to highlight artists from underrepresented groups. Any concerns that ARTXBLM may be  inaccessible or exclusive can be directed
                    to <EmailLink><a href={"mailto:" + "artxblmcollective@gmail.com"}>artxblmcollective@gmail.com</a></EmailLink>, and every concern will be taken 
                    seriously by  the team, which will discuss issues and work to resolve them.<br/>
                    <br/>

                    <b><i>Community. </i></b>Here at ARTXBLM, we are a unified Collective which operates through collaboration and mutual respect. It is 
                    important that all Organisers and Artists at ARTXBLM feel a sense of belonging, that their opinions are valuable, they are respected, 
                    and are comfortable collaborating and sharing knowledge with other members. Within the Organiser team, there is no authoritative voice; 
                    we guide decisions through discussion as a group, and where appropriate with a specific call for feedback from members of the community. 
                    Artists are encouraged to network within the community and to communicate freely with Buyers and Supporters. We support the autonomy of 
                    Artists to set their specifications for how they wish to contribute, but expect that they adhere to the guidelines set forth in this document.<br/>
                    <br/>

                    <b><i>Respect. </i></b>There is much pain to be expressed and shared and there is power in doing so. We do not want to impose toxic positivity 
                    on our Artists, however we also do not want to excessively traumatize communities that do not need more trauma. While we recognize that this 
                    narrows the framework for Artists to work in, we believe the artists participating in ARTXBLM must ask themselves whether the trauma an image 
                    may convey is worth the message they want to convey, and whether they are the right person to convey this message. We are aware that what may 
                    be empowering to one person may be disturbing to another and we do not want to silence voices, especially the voices of Black artists. However 
                    if we believe an Artwork is insensitive or traumatizing we will seek discourse with the Artist and make decisions on whether to keep their 
                    Artwork on the site based on those conversations.<br/>
                    <br/>

                    <b><i>Accountability. </i></b>Because knowledge is ever-changing, it is important to acknowledge Our own learning process. It is imperative 
                    that as we accumulate knowledge and perspective, we reflect back on any harm our actions may have caused to our peers. Therefore, it is our 
                    responsibility to listen, hold Ourselves accountable and change as we reflect. We do not expect perfect conduct from our Artists, Buyers, 
                    Supporters, and third parties, but we expect an atmosphere of accountability and mindfulness of any harm that can be done to people with or 
                    without intention. Where mistakes have been made We will encourage action-oriented apologies and we will take any measures necessary to 
                    ensure that our accountability standards are met. We vow to not just listen and change, but make the problem-solving process as transparent 
                    as possible.<br/>
                    <br/>

                    <b><i>Longevity. </i></b>We believe real change is sustainable. ARTXBLM is not just a means to drive donations, but to highlight specific 
                    Artists who are working to dismantle oppressive infrastructures within our communities and create an ongoing support system through funding 
                    and collaboration with one another. By bringing attention to Artist instagrams and profiles, we hope to add to the BLM digital community and 
                    connect ethical Buyers to new friends, mentors, and allies. ARTXBLM is in connection with local artists, organizations, and individuals to 
                    bolster dialogue and support for the long run. The purpose of the ARTXBLM website is to ensure the fight for anti-racism is accessible, 
                    continuous, and documented.<br/>
                    <br/> 

                    <b><i>Charity. </i></b>We want to highlight that we are not-for-profit. We do not take credit for this Movement; we are not associated with 
                    the Black Lives Matter organization, but are deeply passionate about the Cause and want to ensure that support for Black Lives Matter continues 
                    long past a news-cycle. This is the driving principle in the creation of ARTXBLM, that we can consistently send financial support to the 
                    communities that need it most. ARTXBLM is built by a group of artists and organisers who have volunteered their time and talent to contribute 
                    to the Movement in a creative and valuable way. In creating this platform together, we have leveraged the belief that our actions have worth 
                    beyond the amount of money we are able to donate.<br/>
                    <br/>

                    <b><i>Equity. </i></b>ARTXBLM’s operations are driven by principles of equity and fairness. This means that we acknowledge that different 
                    communities are affected by structural injustices in distinct, nuanced ways. Our decisions as a group take into account these existing 
                    structural injustices so that the impact of our work is distributed to those who need it most. In line with this value, we provide Black 
                    artists the option to choose up to 50% commission of the profits from sales on their prints. Additionally, we put directed effort into 
                    identifying organizations and groups that <i>inter alia</i> represent intersectional Black identities as recipients of our donations.<br/>
